# Totally-Looks-Like (TTL) Project

This repository contains the code and instructions for running the Totally-Looks-Like (TTL) image matching project. The project aims to address the challenge of matching images based on abstract reasoning about similarities.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the required libraries and software in which the Jupyter notebook or Python script will run.
- You have a basic understanding of machine learning and image processing concepts.

## Folder Structure

The project expects a specific folder structure for training and testing the model. You need to organize your 'train' and 'test' directories as follows:


Inside the 'train' and 'test' folders, create two subdirectories named 'left' and 'right.' Place your left-side images and right-side images in the corresponding folders.

## Running the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script included in the repository.
2. Execute each cell in the notebook from top to bottom. Each cell is designed to run in sequence, and later cells may depend on the output of earlier ones.
